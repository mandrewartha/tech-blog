# Tech Blog

This site was made so that developers could post blog posts and connect with other developers through comments on their posts. Users can create an account where they can edit and manage their blog posts. They also will have a homepage that display a dashboard of recent blog posts in the community. This app was made with JavaScript, MySql, Sequelize and Express. Js. The front end was primarily created using Handlebars alongside CSS.
